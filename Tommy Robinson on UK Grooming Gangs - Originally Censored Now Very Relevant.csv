0,00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.680,My activism and my journalism took me in 2015.
1,00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.080,"I started my activism in 2009, yeah?"
2,00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.520,So I'll give a brief history to my work.
3,00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.320,"Yeah, do that."
4,00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560,I was born in Luton in 1982.
5,00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.120,Luton's a town that's 30 miles north of London.
6,00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.360,"When I was born in 1982, there was one mosque."
7,00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.120,"There's now 45 mosques, okay?"
8,00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.160,How big is Luton?
9,00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.600,"It's 200,000 population."
10,00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.720,And how many mosques?
11,00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.680,45.
12,00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.920,Okay.
13,00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.640,45.
14,00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.800,Luton was named by the CIA as the epicenter for terrorist activities across Europe.
15,00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200,The fertilizer bomb plot was planned in Luton.
16,00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.560,"The 7-7 attacks, they got their bombs in Luton."
17,00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.000,The Stockholm bomber was radicalized in Luton.
18,00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.120,Terrorist attack after terrorist attack has orchestrated and come from Luton.
19,00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.320,"Now, growing up in Luton, as I said, when I was born, I've seen all of this, yeah?"
20,00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.720,"Al-Majradin, you know, Omar Bakri, Abu Hamzah, the two, their head office,"
21,00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.200,"they used to have an organization called Al-Majradin,"
22,00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.680,"who were not a person, they're now a prescribed terrorist organization,"
23,00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.640,but they never were.
24,00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.520,Their head office was in Biscuit Mill in my hometown.
25,00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.920,"So growing up, I had a very life lesson of the influence of Islamist ideology"
26,00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.840,"and what it can do to freedom, yeah?"
27,00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.320,"Also, the grooming gangs, which is something we'll get onto."
28,00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.480,So my cousin was a victim at 14.
29,00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.960,She was hooked on heroin and raped.
30,00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.640,She woke up being raped by gangs of bearded men in the Muslim community.
31,00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.480,She run naked through the streets.
32,00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.800,"Now, what the police done at the time is nothing, yeah?"
33,00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.520,So I grew up watching...
34,00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.360,How old were you when that happened?
35,00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.400,I would have been 13.
36,00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.640,So she was 14.
37,00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.000,"So as all this is happening, and just so people get, Luton is one of the most diverse"
38,00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.520,towns in Great Britain.
39,00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.920,"One of the most diverse towns in Europe, yeah?"
40,00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.720,"So white English are a minority, okay?"
41,00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.400,"Most of the people I love are not white, because I've been brought up in this community, yeah?"
42,00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.520,"So as I've been brought up, in our school playground, when I went to school,"
43,00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.320,you had the Muslim playground and the non-Muslim playground.
44,00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.280,"Like, so I had a very quick learning."
45,00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.160,And then when you go into the school...
46,00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.600,Why were they segregated?
47,00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.680,"Well, they segregated themselves."
48,00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.840,The Muslims did not integrate or assimilate.
49,00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.720,"So when you go into the school dinner table, just so people can picture it,"
50,00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.360,"you'll have whites sitting with blacks, sitting with Indians, sitting with Sikhs,"
51,00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.040,"sitting with Hindus, all sitting together."
52,00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.520,"And in the corner, there'll be 10 tables of Muslims, yeah?"
53,00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.000,"Now, I never understood it as a child, okay?"
54,00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000,"It was from when I went to high school, I just knew the Pakistanis are very different, yeah?"
55,00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.280,They're quite hostile.
56,00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.880,"If you mess with one, you've declared war with the whole tribe, yeah?"
57,00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.080,There's not a fair fight.
58,00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.440,There's never a one-on-one fight.
59,00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.880,It's all gang-related.
60,00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.600,And I learnt...
61,00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.280,So I just grew up learning it.
62,00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.640,But that's not to say...
63,00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.840,"Because some of the best people I've met in my hometown were Muslim lads, yeah?"
64,00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.160,Some of the people I loved were Muslim lads.
65,00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.560,"But per se, there was a real problem here."
66,00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800,"And I grew up watching it, learning it."
67,00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.800,"And Al-Majreddin, my first activism was in 2004."
68,00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.760,I was...
69,00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.400,What was I doing?
70,00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.200,20?
71,00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.200,"2004, I organised a protest."
72,00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.720,And this group...
73,00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.560,"Well, do you remember the Beslem School Massacre?"
74,00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.760,No.
75,00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.400,So Beslem School Massacre was Chechnyan...
76,00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.800,Chechnyan terrorists had took control of a school.
77,00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.920,"And this is coming again, yeah?"
78,00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.760,"This is going to happen to a Jewish school, I guarantee you."
79,00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.320,Mm-hmm.
80,00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.600,They took control of a school.
81,00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.360,"And I was probably 20, 19 or something."
82,00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.400,That was where...
83,00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.840,This was in Chechnya and Russia.
84,00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.200,"Yeah, okay, I remember the story."
85,00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.240,"And what happened was, the parents were all outside the school."
86,00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.520,"And all the Muslim jihadists are inside the school with their pupils, with their children."
87,00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.240,Mm-hmm.
88,00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.400,And then they start butchering them and killing them.
89,00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.680,"And I remember watching the parents drop to their knees and they're screaming, yeah?"
90,00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.040,"And I remember watching it thinking, what is this..."
91,00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.760,What has...
92,00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.080,This isn't one man that's gone in and done this.
93,00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.080,This is a whole group of people.
94,00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.720,So what...
95,00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.000,And then I had to understand what brings someone to do that.
96,00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.160,"And two weeks later, I saw an interview in a chicken shop in my hometown of Luton,"
97,00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.680,"with a man called Saif El Islam, which translates as Sword of Islam."
98,00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.720,"He was second in command of Al-Madridin, the group, yeah?"
99,00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.640,Who had... whose head office is in my town.
100,00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.960,"And I saw him saying, an attack like that would be justified in a British school."
101,00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.880,And that was my wake up.
102,00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.160,"I said, who's this man?"
103,00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.960,And I looked him up.
104,00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.840,Who's his group?
105,00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.040,And I looked up who they were.
106,00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.480,And then I looked up Omar Bakri.
107,00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.680,And then I started understanding their ideology and trying to work out...
108,00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.400,"And then for me, these are a danger, yeah?"
109,00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.920,So then I organised and I looked...
110,00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.200,And they used to have a stall set up.
111,00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.760,So we have a...
112,00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.080,"Don Miller's Bakery, a famous..."
113,00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.760,"It's like your Tim Hortons, yeah?"
114,00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.600,We have a bakery chain in Luton Town Centre.
115,00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.800,"And every Saturday, this terrorist group are there openly promoting hatred, yeah?"
116,00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.560,"Just openly sending people to fight for the Taliban, recruiting people."
117,00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.520,"So the Stockholm bomber, who was an Iraqi Muslim who come to university in Luton,"
118,00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.480,"was a nice young man till he come to Luton, yeah?"
119,00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.080,"And then when you're vulnerable at your most vulnerability,"
120,00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.240,"away from home for the first time, in university, they pounce."
121,00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.160,"Yeah, that's typical cult behaviour."
122,00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.280,This is what... so they pounce.
123,00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.840,Yeah.
124,00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.800,"And they got him and then he went and blew himself up, yeah?"
125,00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.320,So these groups have been operating.
126,00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.040,"So I organised a protest called Ban the Luton Taliban, yeah?"
127,00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.320,"Well, I actually... I gave a presentation at Oxford University."
128,00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.960,When was that?
129,00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.000,That was 2004.
130,00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.640,Mm-hmm.
131,00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.840,So I gave a presentation at Oxford University because I made leaflets.
132,00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.480,"And if you dig up the leaflet, which I'd done for my Oxford University presentation in 2004,"
133,00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.480,"my rhetoric has never changed, okay?"
134,00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.120,So the leaflet was put as front page of our local newspaper.
135,00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.160,"And what I said is, whites and blacks are being religiously and racially targeted in this town, yeah?"
136,00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.600,No one's doing anything about it.
137,00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.080,"There's a total toothier policing operation in this town,"
138,00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.360,where they get away with what they want.
139,00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.880,The Islamic community get away with what they want.
140,00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.360,They don't... the police do not know how to deal with these problems.
141,00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.520,I went on to say that they use drugs as a weapon against our community
142,00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.120,"to get our children into paedophilic practices, which is what was now known as grooming."
143,00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.160,"Now, when I made this... and I was a young man, yeah?"
144,00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.440,And I organised it with my friends.
145,00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.480,We go to football together.
146,00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.680,"Luton's one of the most... it was voted the roughest town in Great Britain, yeah?"
147,00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.320,It's a rough place.
148,00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.440,But we went...
149,00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.080,What makes it rough?
150,00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.760,They were hat makers.
151,00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.640,We were hat makers.
152,00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.520,What makes you rough?
153,00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.160,That's all that mercury...
154,00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.960,That's the history of...
155,00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.440,"Oh, maybe."
156,00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.240,"Luton's a... it's a poverty-stricken town with a lot of problems, regardless of Islam."
157,00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.440,Luton has a lot of problems.
158,00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.400,It's a rough environment.
159,00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.600,It's the levels of violence are as high as anywhere in the UK.
160,00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.640,But what you grow up thinking is normal actually isn't normal.
161,00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.840,"You grow up with a level of violence in your school, on your streets,"
162,00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840,or the way to solve things is through violence.
163,00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.680,"And it's a poor town, yeah?"
164,00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.160,Yeah.
165,00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.400,So I organised this group.
166,00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.480,"About 200 of us turned up, Englishmen."
167,00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.480,"And for the first time it worked, the terrorist group weren't there."
168,00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.280,Yeah?
169,00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.920,The jihadists weren't there that day because we were coming.
170,00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.480,Yeah?
171,00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.440,And the police locked it down.
172,00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.200,But what happened from that point...
173,00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.240,The police...
174,00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.120,Tell me what they did.
175,00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.680,"No, the police..."
176,00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.280,"On this day, the police turned up."
177,00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.840,We went to...
178,00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.040,We went to Don Miller's.
179,00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.000,The group weren't there.
180,00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.560,"We then stood, held a little protest at our council building,"
181,00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.640,"saying we need to get rid of these terrorists, yeah?"
182,00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.080,This was before 7-7.
183,00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.480,This is before any terrorist attacks in Great Britain.
184,00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.680,This was these...
185,00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.440,The terrorist attacks we've seen in the...
186,00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.440,"So 60% of the Muslims in Great British prison, in Great Britain's jails,"
187,00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.320,"are ex-members of this group in Luton, yeah?"
188,00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.880,So...
189,00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.520,Okay.
190,00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.200,So you actually had put your finger on them?
191,00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.320,I put my finger on them.
192,00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.680,And I named in the leaflet...
193,00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.920,What I named in the leaflet was the link between the street drug gangs called...
194,00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.280,We have a gang called the Gambinos.
195,00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.480,They're not very original.
196,00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.600,"They're a Pakistani group, but they've called themselves the Gambinos."
197,00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.000,"And three years, four years later, the national newspaper..."
198,00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.600,"So in 2004, I named them in my leaflet and say,"
199,00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.920,"we've had enough of the gangs with their heroin,"
200,00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.760,and we've had enough of the jihadists all combining.
201,00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.120,"And what happened after this was I was targeted by the gangs,"
202,00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.080,"not by the jihadists, by the street-level drug gangs"
203,00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.680,"who were drinking alcohol, gambling."
204,00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.800,They're not religious.
205,00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.960,They're just out pumping heroin and controlling the streets and prostitution.
206,00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.080,I was targeted by them.
207,00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.680,"Now, years later, the national newspapers run a link"
208,00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.760,"showing the link between the Gambinos, they named them, and terrorists."
209,00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.600,They work alongside each other.
210,00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.000,"And at the time, the Luton Islamic Centre, which is the main mosque of Luton,"
211,00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.160,the main Salafist mosque of Luton.
212,00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.920,"It's the old synagogue, ironically, before the Jews were driven out."
213,00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.960,It's the old synagogue. It's now convenient.
214,00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.440,But Qadir Basque was the leader of this mosque.
215,00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.080,"Now, at the time, I then started looking at this mosque,"
216,00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.000,"because my friends who were Muslim had said,"
217,00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.920,"bruv, that's the problem."
218,00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.840,"In this town, that's the problem."
219,00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.400,"So I went on their website, and I translated their website,"
220,00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.160,and I found a seven-page justification for women to be lashed for adultery.
221,00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.720,Yeah?
222,00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.200,I found justification for killing for apostates.
223,00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.120,"This is on the main mosque, yeah?"
224,00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.800,"So I translated it all, and then,"
225,00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.400,"basically, I faced a backlash from the Pakistani gangs."
226,00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.840,"And I had problems then, but at this time, I'm being honest,"
227,00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.160,I was part of a Luton football scene.
228,00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.240,So I used to go football with my friends.
229,00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.480,The Saturday would be the day that all the English lads would come together
230,00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.080,for Luton Town Football Club.
231,00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.320,"It was a cultural thing, I guess."
232,00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.720,"I've never claimed to be an angel, either."
233,00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.520,So I was part of a football scene.
234,00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.480,"So we clashed then with the drug gangs, the Muslim drug gangs."
235,00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.400,And five years goes past.
236,00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.800,"By this point, I'm..."
237,00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.400,Do you think you did something wrong there?
238,00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.160,"No, I didn't do anything."
239,00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.360,I stood up against them.
240,00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.560,"Stood up against them, and at times, so I knew those gangs,"
241,00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.840,because we're all the same age.
242,00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.960,"I went to school with them, yeah?"
243,00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.000,"Stood up against them, and I remember when they were getting"
244,00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.400,"with one of my friend's little sisters, and I rang my sister..."
245,00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.800,"I rang the family and said, do not let her near them."
246,00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.840,"I'm telling you, yeah?"
247,00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.200,"At the time, don't let her near them."
248,00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.640,I know what's going to happen.
249,00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.800,"And then I had all the gangs having problems with me then,"
250,00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.760,"saying, what's going on?"
251,00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.960,"Because I knew them, yeah?"
252,00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.000,What's going on?
253,00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.760,"I said, you're not doing to her what you do."
254,00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.720,I know the family.
255,00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.080,"It's not happening, that's, yeah?"
256,00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.200,The amount of girls I know who lives have been destroyed
257,00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.640,"through these prostitution drug gangs, and they start off nice with the girls."
258,00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.440,They get them in.
259,00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.280,They treat them well.
260,00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.080,They give them money.
261,00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.240,"These are 13-year-old children, yeah?"
262,00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.040,They give them drink.
263,00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.920,They give them alcohol.
264,00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.000,They'll drive them around in their sports cars.
265,00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000,"Gradually, gradually, bang, they're gone."
266,00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.280,"The girl's gone, yeah?"
267,00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.080,The girl's gone.
268,00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.200,"And as I said, when the family..."
269,00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.520,Is that when you became aware of grooming?
270,00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.000,Yeah.
271,00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.800,I became aware because my cousin and all the other girls went to school with.
272,00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.480,"But at the time, we viewed them."
273,00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.240,"So at school, the English kids, we just viewed the girls ourselves."
274,00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.280,We viewed them wrong.
275,00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.840,"We viewed them as slags, because they're off with all the Pakistani men,"
276,00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.680,the older men.
277,00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.640,"We were viewing them as children, just looking, saying,"
278,00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.000,what are they doing with all the taxi drivers?
279,00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.280,And they're going out of all the older Pakistani men.
280,00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.120,"I watched your video about the woman now who's older,"
281,00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.320,who talked about...
282,00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.880,The gangs.
283,00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.520,"The gangs when she was young, and she would get into a car"
284,00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.800,and lay down so that her mum...
285,00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.320,"Hide when her mum's in the car, yeah."
286,00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.440,Yeah.
287,00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.160,"So all of these things are going on, yeah?"
288,00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.560,"But by this point, we get to 2009."
289,00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.640,"When did you start to understand that your view of the girls,"
290,00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.920,"the view of the girls that you had when you were 15 or thereabouts,"
291,00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.080,"when you were treating them like sluts, was wrong?"
292,00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.320,Yeah.
293,00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.520,When did you figure that out?
294,00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.640,When I become an adult.
295,00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.720,"When I become an adult and started looking, thinking..."
296,00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.520,And then when I...
297,00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.400,So 2009...
298,00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.280,"So 2004, I do this protest."
299,00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.280,We have a backlash from all the Pakistani drug gangs.
300,00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.840,"We carry on, sort of..."
301,00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.120,We get through that.
302,00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.080,I've grown up.
303,00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.480,"I've then, by this point, got two successful businesses."
304,00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.120,"Between me and my wife, we had seven properties."
305,00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.600,We were doing...
306,00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.240,We were successful.
307,00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.760,"We were doing well in life, yeah?"
308,00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.120,"And then 2009, we have a soldiers homecoming parade."
309,00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.800,So they weren't out there at war.
310,00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.920,"It was the Royal Anglian Regiment, which is our local regiment."
311,00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.320,"Now, Scott Muntridge is 26 years old."
312,00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.200,He's from the estate I grew up in when I was young.
313,00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.920,And he died.
314,00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.040,Michael Swain was 19 and lost his legs.
315,00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.800,When the soldiers...
316,00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.120,I turned up on a Tuesday morning with my cousin.
317,00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.680,"And it wasn't well publicised, but we turned up to pay our respects."
318,00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.120,"And when I turned up, I saw about 20 women in full niqabs,"
319,00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.800,which is quite a sight when you see them together.
320,00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.200,"And then I looked and saw Saiful Islam, the leader of this Islamic group,"
321,00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.480,the Sword of Islam.
322,00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.120,"I looked and saw him, and then I started seeing more of them."
323,00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.800,"And then I saw police everywhere, and I'm thinking,"
324,00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.120,"no way, yeah?"
325,00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.120,"Something's going to go down here, yeah?"
326,00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.240,Then I saw the...
327,00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.520,I watched this myself.
328,00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.520,I watched as the police took a group.
329,00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.240,"Now, what the..."
330,00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.800,Because some of our friends got arrested at this event.
331,00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.160,We got the intelligence.
332,00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.240,"Now, the police actually on the motorway stopped 360 other Muslims"
333,00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.920,"coming into Luton that day, yeah?"
334,00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.880,So there was a full-on...
335,00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.040,There was going to be a full-on attack against our armed forces
336,00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.800,on there as they walked through the town.
337,00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.920,"But as they walked through the town,"
338,00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.680,I watched as the local...
339,00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.000,As the...
340,00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.080,"Sorry, these were the armed forces that had come back from..."
341,00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.360,Come back from Afghanistan or Iraq.
342,00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.760,"From Africa, okay."
343,00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.640,"Yeah, training."
344,00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.200,They were training.
345,00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.920,They went to war there.
346,00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.160,They were training.
347,00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.640,I see.
348,00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.600,"Okay, okay."
349,00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.680,So they had the freedom of the city because they've been away.
350,00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.560,So then they come to get their march and the public can come out and support them.
351,00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.840,And it was all downplayed anyway.
352,00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.560,It was on a Tuesday.
353,00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.440,It wasn't publicized.
354,00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.520,We knew it because we know people in the regiment.
355,00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.240,So we've gone down that day and then I watched the town hall.
356,00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.440,"Now, picture this."
357,00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.720,This is our town hall.
358,00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.560,"Remember, this group have all gone on to be imprisoned for ISIS, yeah?"
359,00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.800,"So, but that's who they were at the time, yeah?"
360,00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.400,"But no one knows who they are, really."
361,00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.640,No one has the knowledge of what these men are like.
362,00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.320,We do because we're born there.
363,00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:44.960,I've looked at it.
364,00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.680,I've researched them.
365,00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.560,I know who they are.
366,00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.560,I know the danger of this idea.
367,00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.440,It's 2009.
368,00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.200,"I'm sitting there, standing there."
369,00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.480,And I watched my police walk them all through the town hall.
370,00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.560,They opened up our town hall doors and walked them through.
371,00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.400,"I thought, what's going on there?"
372,00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.360,"And then as the soldiers are marching here, then you just hear all commotion."
373,00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.080,So I go running around the back of the town hall.
374,00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.800,They've took them through the town hall to stand.
375,00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.200,"As the soldiers walk here, the Muslim groups here, and they're spitting at the soldiers."
376,00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.880,"They spit in, Scott Monridge, who's dead, they spit in his mum's face, yeah?"
377,00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.800,They spat in the families and they're shouting.
378,00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.880,"Right, and that's assault, just to be straight."
379,00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.520,Just to be straight.
380,00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.040,"Baby killers, butchers of Basra, that's what they're calling the soldiers."
381,00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.120,"Now, my opinion of that war has changed from back then as well, yeah?"
382,00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.880,I believe it was an illegal invasion.
383,00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.600,"I believe it was disgusting what our government's done, yeah?"
384,00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.520,But my opinion has changed on the motive of the war.
385,00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.200,"But, and our soldiers don't get to choose the war they go into."
386,00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.720,"They swear allegiance to Queen and country, and the government send them to war."
387,00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.400,"Now, if these people are upset about the war, take it to the government, yeah?"
388,00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.200,"But they stood in front of our soldiers, and at this point, I was with my cousin there that day,"
389,00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.440,"and there was, I mean, you could have lit a match and our town would have blown up at this time, yeah?"
390,00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.640,That's how we felt.
391,00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.600,"But I'll tell you why we felt that, because I'm a proud Lutonian."
392,00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.880,"Luton is part of the identity of who I am, is where I've been brought up."
393,00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.880,"And the only time you ever hear our hometown mentioned, ever, is to do with terrorists and jihad."
394,00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.360,"And now, our soldiers have been attacked in our town, yeah?"
395,00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.480,By these jihadists.
396,00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.880,"And not just attacked, but the police walked them through the town hall to do it."
397,00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.720,"So I watched it that day, and then, and I watched the police's reaction."
398,00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.560,They didn't turn on the Muslims at all.
399,00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.760,They stood with their backs to the Muslims.
400,00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.680,So the Muslims were all here screaming abuse.
401,00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.480,"They stood with their batons to all the English people,"
402,00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.200,who were upset at what they're just allowed to happen.
